# Prospectus

The goal of this program is to support basic research and development of computational methods that support open source, inclusive and transparent information infrastructure.

*An information infrastructure is defined by Ole Hanseth (2002) as "a shared, evolving, open, standardized, and heterogeneous installed base" and by Pironti (2006) as all of the people, processes, procedures, tools, facilities, and technology which supports the creation, use, transport, storage, and destruction of information.*

This program covers research on Collective Intelligence, Cryptography & Cryptosystems, CyberPhysical Systems, Data Privacy, Distributed Computing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Mechanism Design.


## Priorities

In addition to advancing the technical fields in question, research groups that demonstrate an awareness for the societal impacts of their research will be given priority.

## Technologies

Research topics are presented in alphabetical order. Academic and Industry research groups will be considered on the basis of past accomplishments, the quality of research proposals and the potential impact of the proposed research. Research that bridges topics effectively will be prioritized.

General audience friendly definitions are provided via wikipedia; for academic bona fidas see cited sources.

### Collective Intelligence

"*Collective intelligence (CI) is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in consensus decision making. ... It may involve consensus, social capital and formalisms such as voting systems, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity*"
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence)

Collective Intelligence research as part of this program should focus on formal methods in signal processing and the capacity of networks of agents to fuse private preferences into collective decisions in a manner consistent with some central goal, with or without explicit coordination protocols.

### Cryptography & Cryptosystems

**Cryptography**
"*Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed such system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so.*"
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)


**Cryptosystems**
*"One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model)."*
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)

A wide range of topics in applied cryptography will be considered, but contributions to cryptosystems are preferred. Crytographic components serve as critical building blocks for the full range of other topics in this research program.

### CyberPhysical Systems

"*A cyberphysical system (CPS) is a computer system in which a mechanism is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms. In cyber-physical systems, physical and software components are deeply intertwined, able to operate on different spatial and temporal scales, exhibit multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interact with each other in ways that change with context.*"
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system)

CyberPhysical Systems are higher order combinations of technological infrastructure including accounting for adversarial behavior. Signal Processing and Control of large scale scale and/or networked systems fall within this research topic. 

### Data Privacy

*"Data privacy is challenging since it attempts to use data while protecting an individual's privacy preferences and personally identifiable information. The fields of computer security, data security, and information security all design and use software, hardware, and human resources to address this issue."*
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy)

Privacy considerations take many forms from federated learning over encrypted data to expanding zero-knowledge proof technologies, and much more. Any technologies which provide users more control over who can access their data (including transaction histories) are considered relevant.

### Distributed Computing

*"Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal."*
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)

Distributed computing research covers a wide range of topics from Multi-Party Computation (MPC), consensus protocols for distributed ledgers and virtual machines, as well as distributed storage and transportation technologies such distributed hash-tables (DHTs) and routing protocols.

### Human–Computer Interaction

*"Human–computer interaction (HCI) studies the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways."*
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)

Changes in human-computer interactions are a natural consequence of innovation.  Building computing technologies with human needs in mind is critical to realizing the potential of those technologies. 

### Mechanism Design

*"Mechanism design is a field in economics and game theory that takes an objectives-first approach to designing economic mechanisms or incentives, toward desired objectives, in strategic settings, where players act rationally."*
~Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design)

Furthermore, there is a preference for topics addressing games with both spatial and temporal elements, as well as accounting for diverse preference models which extend beyond short-term profit maximization.
